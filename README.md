# FPGrowth
Julia implementation of the FP Growth algorithm from Han, Pei and Yin: [Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/publications/sigmod00.pdf).

Watch [Chapter-7 : FP Growth method with an example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VB8KWm8MXss) for a walk-through of the algorithm and [Chapter-9 : Association rule mining with FP Growth method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToswH_dA7KU) for a walk-through of how to mine the rules.

## Notation
$\xi$ â€“ minimum support threshold
